# Neurobiological Changes Across Pregnancy: A Prospective Longitudinal Investigation

## Overview
This repository hosts the public sharing of data and analysis scripts for our research project titled "Neurobiological Changes Across Pregnancy". Our study focuses on documenting neurobiological changes during pregnancy, with a comprehensive analysis of both structural and biological alterations, as well as their associations, throughout this significant life event. The repository includes processed data and analysis scripts, all aimed at supporting open science, improving replicability, and facilitating knowledge dissemination.

## Directory Structure

### `data/`: Processed Data Files

- **`t1_all.csv`**: Includes volumetric data such as total brain volume, total grey matter volume, total cortical volume, total subcortical volume, cortical thickness, and cortical area. It also encompasses volumes for subcortical regions as defined by the Desikan-Killiany atlas.
- **`csfmap.csv`**: Aggregates volume fractions of CSF images generated by 3D-QALAS across thresholds ranging from 60% to 95%.
- **`matlab_icvf_all.csv`**: Provides the Neurite Density Index (NDI) from the NODDI Matlab Toolbox (Zhang et al., 2012), across fiber tracts segmented by using TractSeg (Wasserthal et al., 2020; Wasserthal, Neher, & Maier-Hein, 2018).
- **`matlab_od_all.csv`**: Offers the Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI) from the NODDI Matlab Toolbox (Zhang et al., 2012), across fiber tracts segmented by TractSeg.
- **`fa_all.csv`**: Contains Fractional Anisotropy (FA) data computed from the standard DTI model (Basser, Mattiello, & LeBihan, 1994), across fiber tracts segmented by TractSeg.
- **`md_all.csv`**: Lists Mean Diffusivity (MD) values computed from the standard DTI model, across fiber tracts segmented by TractSeg.
- **`ad_all.csv`**: Details Axial Diffusivity (AD) computed from the standard DTI model, across fiber tracts segmented by TractSeg.
- **`rd_all.csv`**: Enumerates Radial Diffusivity (RD) values, computed from the standard DTI model, across fiber tracts segmented by TractSeg.
